# 2024 Question 1

## This question is about:
- Create two methods in the Feeder class, 'nano' SimulateOneDay() and simulateManyDays(), in which you simulate when a bird eats at a bird feeder or rarely, a bear.

## Struggles with this question:
- I had an issue where I didn't realize that when caculating the 5 percent chance of the bear coming,I couldn't do radnom < 95, simce it would add 6 percent so I would have to do radnom <= 95.
  
## Prior experiences that helped:
- Learning how to write Math.random() was a huge help, especially since I had to use it twice.

## What I learned by doing this question:
- I learned how to perfectly write the Math.random() function.
