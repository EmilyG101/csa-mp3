# 2024 Question 3

## This question is about:
- We have to keep track of a array list of Strings and we have to write two methods.

## Struggles with this question:
- I didn't have any particular struggles with this but it took a bit to understand the question compared to the other questions, especially part b.

## Prior experiences that helped:
- Working with String methods helped a lot in this question as substring and indexOf were used in this question.

## What I learned by doing this question:
- I learned, finally, how to properly declare an array list.
