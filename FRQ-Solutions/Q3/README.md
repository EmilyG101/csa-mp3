# 2024 Question 3

## This question is about:
- We have to keep track of a array list of Strings and we have to write two methods. These two methods were `isWordChain()` and `createList()`. The method, `isWordChain()`, checks if the previous word is in the next word. The method, `createList()`, creates a list that contains the words in the array with the string target and then removes target from each word.             

## Struggles with this question:
- I didn't have any particular struggles with this but it took a bit to understand the question compared to the other questions, especially part b.

## Prior experiences that helped:
- Working with String methods helped a lot in this question as `.substring()` and `.indexOf()` were used in this question.

## What I learned by doing this question:
- I learned, finally, how to properly declare an array list correctly so that i wouldn't lose any points in declaration.
