# 2024 Question 2

## This question is about:
- A class called ScoreBoard where you have to keep track of two teams scores and which team is active. Then use the scores and active variable to show a display of each team's scores.

## Struggles with this question:
- I didn't realize I needed a boolean variable to keep track of which team is active.

## Prior experiences that helped:
- The project where we wrote classes helped develop the constructors, variables, and methods needed for this question.

## What I learned by doing this question:
- I learned what variables you would need for this situation like the boolean to signify which team is active so that the display for the score board can give the proper points.
