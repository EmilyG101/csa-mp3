# 2024 Question 4

## This question is about:
- This question has two classes, Location and GridPath. You have to use these classes to traverse through a 2D-array and complete the required methods.

## Struggles with this question:
- I didn't understand what the location class was for so I spent a lot more time on this question than compared to the others.

## Prior experiences that helped:
- Traversing through a 2D array with for loops helped in this question a lot for using the classes.

## What I learned by doing this question:
- I learned how to use a class to transverse a 2D array rather than the traditional for loops.
